    The generic indexed supervised reader intentionally only owns record I/O.
    JT keeps its ``data_config`` at the model boundary so the shared Trainer
    can select native batch-sampler balancing without teaching the framework
    about this model family.

    Args:
        data_path: Prefix before the ``.tokens``, ``.labels`` and
            ``.loss_mask`` indexed files.
        sequence_length: Required length for every complete record.
        data_config: Dataset options consumed by the shared DataLoader.

    Returns:
        An aligned supervised Dataset carrying the resolved JT data options.
